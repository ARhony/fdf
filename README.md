# fdf
In this project I discovered the basics of graphic programming and how to place points in space, how to join them and most importantly how to obeserve the scene from a particular viewpoint.

# MLX
I used my first graphic library: minilibX. This library was developed internally and include the minimum neccessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal with events to this window: KEYOARD, MOUSE and EXPOSE. This is an introduction to "events" programming.

# How
Git clone the project, make it and choose a file with the extension .fdf in the folder "files" as an argument.

```
git clone https://github.com/ARhony/fdf.git fdfRhony
cd fdfRhony
make
./fdf files/basic.fdf
```
